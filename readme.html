	<div class="warningbox">Hi there! Please give this document a quick read-through at least once before adding code to the code library.
	If you are just looking to copy some code from the code library, you can skip to doing that!</div>
	
	<p>Welcome to the CWS Sierra Team Code Library! This repository exists to store scripts, utilities, and snapshots of large code projects
	so that the code is searchable and reusable.</p>

	<h2><a name="structure"></a>Files and Structure</h2>
	<p>The folders here include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span class="foldername">code</span> - Intuitively, code lives here. Please create a subfolder with the name of the script, utility
		or project you are working on, even if your script is only a single file. It'll keep things organized.</li>
		
		<li><span class="foldername">dependencies</span> - This is a central folder where we can store installable software that is
		required to run code. Examples would generally be python modules and small executables that members of the Sierra Team are not
		likely to have on their computer without installing them. You can keep these types of files in a specific project's code folder
		if you like, but software required to run more than one script (eg, PyODBC, ImageMagick, etc) really belongs here.</li>
		
		<li><span class="foldername">releases</span> - Totally optional - you don't need to use this folder if you don't want to.
		You can put finished scripts (or finished for the time-being scripts) into this folder as a zip file (with a version number, if possible).
		If you then email Nick (nrsantos@ucd) with the zip file's name, I will post it to Hydra's copy of the code library
		so it can be easily distributed.</li>
		
		<li><span class="foldername">.hg</span> - don't touch this folder. At all. Thank you!</li>
